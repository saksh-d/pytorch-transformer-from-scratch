# PyTorch: Transformer from Scratch

A PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the groundbreaking paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).

## Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of the original Transformer model built from scratch using PyTorch. The implementation closely follows the architecture described in the paper, providing both educational value and a solid foundation for understanding modern attention-based models.
